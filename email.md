Hamlet.coffee is now Jadelet.com!
=================================

Greetings friends! It's been a long time, hasn't it? I hope 2017 is treating you
well... if this year teaches us anything it's that anything is possible :)

There's been some changes here too, aside from just the name. Let's take a gander:

We've dropped the haml style DSL in favor for the cleaner Jade style DSL. There
was very little interest in the haml style and removing support for it allows us
to focus on making a better experience with the style people enjoy.

Administratively, we've consolidate the parser, compiler, cli, and runtime repos
into one place to make it easier to understand the project as a whole. Check it
out here: https://github.com/STRd6/jadelet

Not all the changes have been boring however! We were able to shrink the runtime
down to an impressive 2.8kb along with enhancements to event handling. That's
only 2,772 bytes (minified and gzipped) the smallest of any serious clientside
templating library.

Our new site jadelet.com is launching with updated documentation and tuturials:

- 5 min Getting Started
- Jadelet Basics
- Example Garden

Until next time friends... Never stop believing in yourself! Software _can_ be poetry :)
